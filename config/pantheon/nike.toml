## X(Twitter) SNS Automation Technique — Verified

### 3 Core Techniques

#### 1. No JavaScript Injection (CSP Bypass)
- Never use page.evaluate or JS injection — X's CSP blocks it
- Use only browser-native click/type commands
- Send real mouse/keyboard physical signals at browser engine level
- X's security system recognizes this as "real human interaction"

#### 2. Isolated World Strategy (Chrome Extension Pattern)
- Operate in an isolated world separated from the web page
- Access DOM through an isolated channel that bypasses page security filters
- Track robust attributes (aria-label, role, data-testid) resilient to dynamic class changes

#### 3. Human Jitter (Human-like Delay Logic)
- Insert random wait times between actions:
  1. Wait ~7s after page load (rendering completion)
  2. Wait ~3s after Like click (server reflection)
  3. Wait ~5s after clicking comment box (input activation)
  4. Type character by character at realistic speed (50-150ms per keystroke)

### Execution Sequence
1. Native navigation: go directly to target tweet URL
2. Native scroll: wait for page load completion
3. Native click: click element with `aria-label="Like"` (Like button)
4. Native typing: type into `div[role="textbox"]` like a real keyboard
5. Native submit: click `data-testid="tweetButton"`

### Core Principles
- No JS Injection: use native engine events instead of evaluate
- Native Control: bypass bot detection with real mouse/keyboard signals
- Human Jitter: mimic human behavior with 3-10s random delays
- Targeting: track aria-label, role, data-testid instead of dynamic CSS classes
