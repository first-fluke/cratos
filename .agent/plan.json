    "goal": "Extract the hardcoded system prompt from `crates/cratos-core/src/planner.rs` into `crates/cratos-core/src/prompts/default_system_prompt.md`, decouple personal local paths, remove redundant instruction layers, and use `include_str!` to load it at compile-time.",

        "simplicity": "Passed - using `include_str!` remains a zero-cost compile-time static link."
